## Todo
- Responsive UI for editor and also a custom music player component which should be portable
- mobile responsiveness for sidebar.
- homepage. 
- It is not visible that who one is typing that should be fixed.
- webrtc connection instead of socket.io with mess topology (if needed)
- chat functionality and room Admin control accesses
- syncronization in song when someone new joins the room
- each uploaded song should be saved in roomId directory and that directory should be cleared when all leave instead of all songs.
